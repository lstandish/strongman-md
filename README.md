# strongman-mkdocs
Mkdocs source files for site

This repo contains the markdown files used by mkdocs to build the [Strongman](https://strongman.tech) site.

The Strongman site is not hosted on Github using Github Pages because it is built with the [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) static site generator rather than Jekyl.  Github Pages does not support any static site generator (for markdown files) other than Jekyl.

Therefore, the Strongman site is built (by mkdocs) and hosted on a private site.

For information on how I set up my server and Github to automatically re-build and publish the Strongman site whenever there is a push to this repository, read [here](https://gist.github.com/lstandish/189e53ee726a364a0f2245402b0d6000).
