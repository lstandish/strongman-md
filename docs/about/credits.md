# Credits and Thanks

### Lesspass

[Lesspass] was the inspiration for this program. I wish to thank the creators of Lesspass for making their excellent program open source, and pointing the way for browser-based, stateless password management. I took some of the password generation code from [Lesspass].

### AES-JS

Used in Strongman for AES-256 encryption and decryption in javascript.

!!! Note 
    **From the AES-JS README file:**  
    A pure JavaScript implementation of the AES block cipher algorithm and all common modes of operation (CBC, CFB, CTR, ECB and OFB).  
  
    **Features**  
    1. Pure JavaScript (with no dependencies)  
    2. Supports all key sizes (128-bit, 192-bit and 256-bit)  
    3. Supports all common modes of operation (CBC, CFB, CTR, ECB and OFB)  
    4. Works in either node.js or web browsers

### Jshashes

Used for sha256 hashes in javascript

!!! Note 
    **From the jshashes README file on [Github](https://github.com/h2non/jshashes):**  
    jshashes is lightweight library implementing the most extended cryptographic hash function algorithms in pure JavaScript (ES5 compliant).

    The goal is to provide an dependency-free, fast and reliable solution for hash algorithms for both client-side and server-side JavaScript environments. The code is fully compatible with the ECMAScript 5 specification and is used in production in browsers and node.js/io.js

### biginteger.js

Used for arbitrary-sized big integer arithmetic in javascript
See [https://silentmatt.com/biginteger](https://silentmatt.com/biginteger/)

### Moment.js

Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times in JavaScript. [https://momentjs.com/](https://momentjs.com/)

### Autocomplete for Jquery

Used for Strongman's dropdown list with ajax lookup, which is at the core of the user inferface. [https://github.com/jbdemonte/autocomplete]

Also, thanks to [Jquery](http://jquery.com/) and [w3.css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp)
