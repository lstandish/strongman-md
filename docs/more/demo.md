## Strongman Demo Terms of Use

You may use my hosted instance of Strongman Password Manager, with the understanding that it is intended to be a demo for evaluation purposes only.

Although I will attempt to keep the demo instance permanantly online, I take no responsability for service interruptions or data loss. (This is the plain language version of the disclaimer below.) You are advised to make a regular backup of your account.

In spite of it being a "demo," you may use the demo instance indefinitely as your personal online password manager.
